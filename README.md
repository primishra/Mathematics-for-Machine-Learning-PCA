> Important Note : The python notebooks uploaded here are not mine. I have downloaded them from a github profile because I was unable to download my notebooks from Coursera. So all the credits for ipynb files go to [https://github.com/launchcode01dl/mathematics-for-machine-learning-cousera (PCA)](https://github.com/launchcode01dl/mathematics-for-machine-learning-cousera/tree/master/course3%20-%20principle%20component%20analysis)
